# Design_Patterns_JS

. Design Patterns are typically split into three categories 
. This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors 

1. Creational Patterns 
  . Deal with creation (construction) of objects 
  . Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
  . Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

2. Structural Patterns 
  . Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
  . Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface 
  . Stress the importance of good API design
  
3. Behavioral Patterns 
  .They are all different; no central theme
